Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11
   -check compatibility/system requirements
   -backup your data
   -Create installation media/download the media creation tool and create a bootable USB drive
   -install windows 11

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download.
   -download vs code by going to the Visual Studio code download Page
   -Run the installer by double clicking on the downloaded file
   -follow the installation setup/wizard steps
   -complete installation and launch Vs code.
   
3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com.
   -download Git by visiting Git for windows website and downloading installer.
   -run the installer
   -follow the setup wizard steps
   -complete and verify the installation
   Github account is created by going to github.com and clicking on "create new account"
   

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.
  -Python is installed by first going to the official Python download page and downloading the installer
  -run the install by double clicking the downloaded fil
  -Installatio setup by adding python to path and customizing your installation
  -complete installation and verify if python has been installed.

5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).
   -pip is installed by running the curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
   -after running the above url on a command promt, you command python to get-pip.py  

6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html
   -visit the official MySQL Website
   -go to the download section
   -run the installer
   -Choose setup type
   -Check requirements
   -MySQL Downloading
   -Complete the installation by following the wizard steps
   -Create MySQL account

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.

9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 
    -Choose your Code Editor
    -Install a Version control system
    -Setup a local server Environment
    -Choose a CSS preprocessor
    -select a front-end framework
    -Setup your browser developer tools

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

Note: Feel free to reach out for clarification or assistance with any aspect of the assignment.
